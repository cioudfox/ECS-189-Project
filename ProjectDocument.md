# Game Basic Information #

## Summary ##

In a village located in the middle of nowhere, a survivor fights an impending horde of enemies unique in description and style. The survivor must be resourceful and gather exponentially or multiplicative equipment upgrades to battle their way to the next stage and continue to liberate the various themed locations of enemies. 

## Gameplay Explanation ##

The player survives from the enemy waves as long as possible. The player moves through the 4 arrow keys of up, down, left, right and with consumable buttons of 1,2,3 numpad keys. These consumables vary from increased attack speed, damage, movement speed and health regen and are acquired by vanquishing enemies. On level up players can choose to upgrade health, damage, attack speed or movement speed. As time progresses, waves get more difficult, so survive as long as you can!



# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least 4 such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The background of the game consists of procedurally-generated terrain that is produced with Perlin noise. This terrain can be modified by the game at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.
